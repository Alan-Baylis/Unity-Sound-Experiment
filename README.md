# Unity Sound Experiment
Random sound picker and keyboard mappings.

This is one of my early scripts for Unity, with this each of the Sound Effect keys there is a custom sound effect, which is not provided here (you will have to source them yourself), which play. These are also activated randomly if movement sounds are enabled, by moving horizontally.
